/**
 * Live: drives a real `codex app-server`, signed in to a real ChatGPT plan,
 * so it runs only when asked, on a machine where ChatGPT was connected in the
 * app:
 *
 * UZ_LIVE_CODEX_PROGRAM=<userData>/vendor/chatgpt/<version>\
 * UZ_LIVE_CODEX_HOME=<userData>/providers/chatgpt\
 * bun run test:node app/provider-host/src/modules/codex-driver/streaming.live
 *
 * It copies the sign-in into fresh folders and runs there, so the second
 * app-server of the first test has nothing but the app's copy of the rollouts
 * to resume from, and the third nothing but that copy to fork from.
 * With `UZ_RECORD=yes` it also writes what the driver and `codex` exchanged
 * into `recordings/`, which the driver tests replay. Each test writes its own
 * recordings, so record one at a time with `-t`: the ids the driver tests pin
 * change with every recording.
